# workout_graph

Little Rust project that is supposed to create a nice visualisation (graph or maybe something like the GitHub commit graph) of my workout stats (maybe with WASM?).

Ideally this would let me create a webpage on my [matkv.dev](https://matkv.dev) website and let me regularly import my workout
data from Garmin Connect.
